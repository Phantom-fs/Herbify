        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>In general use, herbs are a widely distributed and widespread group of plants, excluding vegetables 
            and other plants consumed for macronutrients, with savory or aromatic properties that are used for 
            flavoring and garnishing food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances. 
            Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. Herbs generally refers to the leafy green 
            or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), 
            while spices are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including seeds, bark, roots and fruits.</p>

        <p>Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, aromatic 
            and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term "herb" differs between 
            culinary herbs and medicinal herbs; in medicinal or spiritual use, 
            any parts of the plant might be considered as "herbs", including leaves, 
            roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), resin and pericarp.</p>

        <p>In botany, the noun "herb" refers to a "plant that does not 
            produce a woody stem", and the adjective "herbaceous" means 
            "herb-like", referring to parts of the plant that are green and soft in texture".</p>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>In botany, the term herb refers to a herbaceous plant,
             defined as a small, seed-bearing plant without a woody stem 
             in which all aerial parts (i.e. above ground) die back to the ground 
             at the end of each growing season. Usually the term refers to perennials,
              although herbaceous plants can also be annuals (plants that die at the 
              end of the growing season and grow back from seed next year), or biennials. 
              This term is in contrast to shrubs and trees which possess a woody stem.
               Shrubs and trees are also defined in terms of size, where shrubs are less than ten meters tall,
                and trees may grow over ten meters. The word herbaceous is derived from Latin herbāceus 
                meaning "grassy", from herba "grass, herb".</p>

        <p>Another sense of the term herb can refer to a much larger range of plants,
             with culinary, therapeutic or other uses. For example, some of the most 
             commonly described herbs such as sage, rosemary and lavender would be excluded 
             from the botanical definition of an herb as they do not die down each year, 
             and they possess woody stems. In the wider sense, herbs may be herbaceous 
             perennials but also trees, subshrubs, shrubs, annuals, lianas, 
             ferns, mosses, algae, lichens, and fungi. Herbalism can utilize 
             not just stems and leaves but also fruit, roots, bark and gums. Therefore, 
             one suggested definition of an herb is a plant which is of use to humans, 
             although this definition is problematic since it could cover a great many plants 
             that are not commonly described as herbs.</p>

        <h2>Uses</h2>

        <h3>Culinary</h3>
        <p>Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, 
            they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food.</p>

        <p>Herbs can be perennials such as thyme, oregano, sage or lavender, 
            biennials such as parsley, or annuals like basil. Perennial herbs 
            can be shrubs such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), or trees 
            such as bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) - this contrasts with botanical herbs, 
            which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as 
            both herbs and spices, such as dill weed and dill seed or coriander leaves 
            and seeds. There are also some herbs, such as those in the mint family, that 
            are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>

        <p>Emperor Charlemagne (742-814) compiled a list of 74 different herbs that were 
            to be planted in his gardens. The connection between herbs and health 
            is important already in the European Middle Ages--The Forme of Cury 
            (that is, "cookery") promotes extensive use of herbs, including in salads, 
            and claims in its preface "the assent and advisement of the masters of 
            physic and philosophy in the King's Court".</p>

        <h3>Teas</h3>
        <p>Some herbs can be infused in boiling water to make herbal teas 
            (also termed tisanes). Typically the dried leaves, flowers or seeds are 
            used, or fresh herbs are used. Herbal teas tend to be made from aromatic herbs, 
            may not contain tannins or caffeine, and are not typically mixed with milk.
             Common examples include chamomile tea, or mint tea.
              Herbal teas are often used as a source of relaxation or can be associated with rituals.[11]</p>

        <h3>Medicine</h3>

            with a small lake in the background near trees.
        A traditional Chinese decoction (湯劑/汤剂), using Chinese herbs</p>

        <p>Nicholas Culpeper was an English botanist, herbalist, physician, and astrologer.
             (etching by Richard Gaywood between 1644 and 1662)
        Herbs were used in prehistoric medicine. As far back as 5000 BCE, 
        evidence that Sumerians used herbs in medicine was inscribed on cuneiform. 
        In 162 CE, the physician Galen was known for concocting complicated herbal 
        remedies that contained up to 100 ingredients.</p>

        <p>Some plants contain phytochemicals that have effects on the body. 
            There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels 
            that typify culinary "spicing", and some herbs are toxic in larger 
            quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the 
            extract of St. John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) or of kava (Piper methysticum) 
            can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress.
             However, large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload 
             that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should 
             be used with caution. Complications can also arise when being taken with some prescription medicines.</p>

        <h3>Ritual</h3>
        <p>Herbs are used in many religions. During the monastic era, monks 
            would cultivate herbs alongside vegetables, while others would be 
            set aside in a physic garden for specific purposes.
             For example, myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) and frankincense 
             (Boswellia species) in Hellenistic religion, the nine herbs 
             charm in Anglo-Saxon paganism, neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, 
             bael (Aegele marmelos) leaves, holy basil or tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum), 
             turmeric or "haldi" (Curcuma longa), cannabis in Hinduism, and 
             white sage in Wicca. Rastafari also consider cannabis to be a holy plant.</p>

        <h3>Cosmetics</h3>
        <p>Originally there was always doubt in ancient societies, especially in the 
            sceptical medium of western traditions, as to the efficacity of herbal 
            medicines. The use of herbal cosmetics dates back to around six 
            centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and 
            pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, 
            herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, 
            with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in 
            many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, 
            powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens. They activate through the 
            epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple. Ayurvedic oils 
            are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties.</p>

        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>Main article: Strewing herb
        Strewing herbs are scattered (strewn) over the floors of 
        dwelling places and other buildings. Such plants usually have 
        fragrant or astringent smells, and many also serve as insecticides 
        (e.g. to repel fleas) or disinfectants. For example, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) 
        was sometimes strewn across floors in the Middle Ages because of its sweet smell.</p>
